various frameworks and projects for the open-source humanoid platform PIB (https://pib.rocks/);
Developed as part of the project 'Labouratory' at Nuremberg Campus of Technology.

# NOTES:
- The 'Pib_Remote' application in the eponymous folder requires the SDL_Application OOP framework (https://github.com/Hukeng-Art/SDL_Application) to be compiled and run.
Make sure the SDL_Application folder is located in the same directory as the 'Pib' folder before running the compile script.
